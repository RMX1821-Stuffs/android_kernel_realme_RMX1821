Information regarding missing commit history
============================================

We had a shallow clone of the original kernel repository when it was public, but at the momemnt they are made private or deleted by the lead developer(@Arrowsploit). Hence we uploaded the buildable kernel source, even if 90% of the commits history is missing.

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
